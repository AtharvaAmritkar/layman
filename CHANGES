-------

Version TODO

     Thanks for the patch to Dmitry Karasik!

 - Fix handling of non-existing overlays


Version 1.3.0 - Released 2010/01/19
===================================

 - Move storage default from /usr/local/portage/layman
   to /var/lib/layman (fixes bug #253725)

 - Syncing failed for overlays that no longer exist in the remote
   lists without need to (bug #301174)

 - No longer treat sync warnings like errors (bug #301327)

Version 1.3.0_rc1 - Released 2010/01/15
=======================================

 - Add support for several sources per overlay (also fixes #280472)
     When adding an overlay all sources will be probed until a working
     one is found.  This should help Layman through some firewalls.

Version 1.2.6 - Released 2010/01/12
===================================

 - Warn on lack of write permissions (fixes #260218)

 - Migrate to GNU tar's compression format auto-detection
   which adds potential support for more types of compressed
   tar archives (LZMA, xz or Z) as a side-effect
   (Requires GNU tar 1.15 or later, released in 2005)

 - Drop support for broken tar overlays with missing category level
   (and missing profiles/repo_name as a consequence)

 - Make missing overlay directory not fail removal of that overlay
   from the local list

 - Start shipping doc sources and release notes with release archives

 - Start shipping test suite files missing from the 1.2.5 release
