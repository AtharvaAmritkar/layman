This is the C version of the new layman API.

To use it, you must first get the new Layman API :

	git clone http://dev.gentooexperimental.org/~dol-sen/git/layman.git

Then, type
	
	./configure
	make

After that, you can compile and run the tester with

	./run-test.sh

Note that it's still in an unstable state, try to always use the latest git
version of this library and of the new Layman API.
