Version 1.3.0_rc1 - Released 2010/01/15
=======================================

FULL CHANGES
------------

 - Add support for several sources per overlay (also fixes #280472)
     When adding an overlay all sources will be probed until a working
     one is found.  This should help Layman through some firewalls.

 - Display related directory when deleting overlays

 - Improve overlay info display (i.e. layman -i):
   - Add quality indicator (keep in mind: no guarantee)
   - Add feed URIs
   - Fix whitespace handling for description field

 - Improve layman usage display


SHORT CHANGES
-------------

 layman-1.3.0_rc1 introduces support for several sources per overlay.
 Also, "layman -i OVERLAY" now makes full use of metadata that arrived
 with the migration from layman-global.txt to the repositories.xml format.
