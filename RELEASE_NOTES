Version 1.2.6 - Released 2010/01/12
===================================

FULL CHANGES
------------

 - Warn on lack of write permissions (fixes #260218)

 - Migrate to GNU tar's compression format auto-detection
   which adds potential support for more types of compressed
   tar archives (LZMA, xz or Z) as a side-effect
   (Requires GNU tar 1.15 or later, released in 2005)

 - Drop support for broken tar overlays with missing category level
   (and missing profiles/repo_name as a consequence)

 - Make missing overlay directory not fail removal of that overlay
   from the local list

 - Start shipping doc sources and release notes with release archives

 - Start shipping test suite files missing from the 1.2.5 release


SHORT CHANGES
-------------

 layman-1.2.6 introduces support for tar overlays that are compressed
 with an algorithm other than gzip or bzip2.  That, plus minor fixes.
