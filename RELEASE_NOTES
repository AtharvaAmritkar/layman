===================================

 - Handle command line calls "layman" and "layman foo" better.
     Former now shows a usage summary while latter now reports
     an error.  Both of them kept quiet before.

 - Replace os.system() by subprocess.Popen()

 - Close stdin of child processes when run in quiet mode
   to avoid running into infinite and blindly interactive sessions.
